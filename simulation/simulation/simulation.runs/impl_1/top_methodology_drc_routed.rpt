2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell a2/mux2_reg[1]_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) a2/mux2_reg[1]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell a2/mux3_reg_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) a2/mux3_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
